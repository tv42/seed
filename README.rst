seed -- Easily generate semi-strong random number seeds in Go
=============================================================

This is a trivial helper to easily initialize PRNGs with some entropy,
in the Go programming language.

It's MIT licensed, but probably too trivial to have any protection any
way. Go forth and use it.

Install like this::

  go get github.com/tv42/seed
